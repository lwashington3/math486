\begin{problems}
	\problem Consider the irreversible chemical reaction: $A \rightarrow^{k_{1}} B \rightarrow^{k_{2}} C$.
	\begin{problems}
		\subproblem Derive the system of differential equations for the concentrations $A = A(t)$, $B = B(t)$, and $C = C(t)$ with initial conditions $A(0) = A_{0}$, $B(0) = 0$, and $C(0) = 0$.
		\subproblem Find a conservation law that replaces the need for the $dC/dt$ equation.
		\subproblem Solve the equations in~\ref{prb:1a} for $A$ and $B$ then use the conservation law to find $C$.
		\subproblem If $k_{1} = k_{2} = k$, solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$.
		\subproblem If $k_{1} = k_{2} = k$, find the maximum amount of $B$ that is produced.
	\end{problems}
	\problem Consider the dimerization to two monomers example from class
	\[ A + A \leftrightarrows^{k_{-1}}_{k_{1}} C \]
	\begin{problems}
		\subproblem Derive the system of differential equations for the concentrations $A = A(t)$ and $C = C(t)$ with initial conditions $A(0) = A_{0}$ and $C(0) = 0$.
		\subproblem Find a conservation law that replaces the need for the $dC/dt$ equation and derive the equation for $A(t)$.
		\subproblem If $k_{1} = k_{2} = k$ and $A_{0} = 1$, find the steady-state values for $A(t)$ and $C(t)$, i.e. limits as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
